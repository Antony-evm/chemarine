  overview: [
    "Stand Alone Station: The SDM-Force is a versatile maintenance tool that automates the service of a GX-Force portable gas monitor. This docking station can be used as a stand alone device for charging, calibrating and bump testing, with all records stored automatically for future upload to a PC via USB flash drive (PC software and flash drive included).",
    "PC Controlled System: The SDM-Force can also be connected to a PC for automated calibration, bump testing, and archiving of datalog data from GX-Force instruments. Up to ten SDM-Force docking stations can be connected simultaneously using USB cables and the SDM-Force includes connections for one to three calibration gas cylinders.",
