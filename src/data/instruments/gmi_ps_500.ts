  overview: [
    "Designed by our customers, this robust and accurate gas detector provides unrivaled protection in confined space applications.",
    "The PS500 can be tailored to detect up to fi​ve gases with its toxic and catalytic sensors, photo ionisation detectors, and infrared capabilities. “Plug and Play” option allows the customer to “plug in” a new board with a different gas range.",
    "The PS500 is particularly useful in noisy environments, featuring a very loud (95dBA) penetrating and distinctive audible alarm together with high visibility large area visual alarm.",
    "Pump, diffusion or both together, allowing pumped sample for pre-entry checking and diffusion in confined space working, thus maximising battery life.",
    "A robust, moulded, rubberised casing guaranteeing Hi-Impact resistance, the PS500 can be used in the most demanding industrial environments.",
